# Contributing

Thank you for helping with @0x1audio/sdk, the page SDK for Mixel apps. A good bug report is as welcome as a pull request.

## Issues

- **Bugs:** say what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead. Add your OS, the version or commit, and any error text.
- **Ideas and bigger changes:** open an issue before you write the code, so we can agree on the shape first.
- **Security problems:** please don't open a public issue. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) explains how to tell us privately.

## Set up

You need Git and Node with npm.

```bash
git clone <this repository> 0x1audio-sdk-ts
cd 0x1audio-sdk-ts
npm install
```

Two parts are generated, so don't edit them by hand: `src/contract.gen.ts` comes from the contract in the Python SDK (`0x1audio-sdk-py/contract/`), and `src/client/` comes from `openapi.json` (`npm run generate`).

## Run the checks

Run these before you open a pull request:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Pull requests

- Keep each pull request to one change, and say what changed and why.
- Add or update tests with the change.
- For anything on screen, add screenshots in light and dark.
- Sign off every commit (see below).

A maintainer reviews every pull request. We may ask for changes; that's normal, and it's about the code, never about you.

## Sign off your commits (DCO)

We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) (DCO) instead of a contributor licence agreement. You keep the copyright on your work. By signing off, you confirm you have the right to contribute it.

Add `-s` when you commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Explain the change"
```

Git adds a line with your name and email from `git config`:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Use your real name, or the name you're known by in open source. Forgot one? `git commit --amend -s` fixes the last commit, and `git rebase --signoff main` fixes every commit on your branch. Then force-push the branch.

## Your contribution's licence

Everything you contribute is licensed under **Apache-2.0**, the same licence as the rest of this repository ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). There is no separate agreement and no relicensing.

## The bar

**Code.** Small and readable beats clever. Every change comes with its tests, the checks above pass, and no secrets go into the repository.

## The name

The code is open, and the name "Mixel" and its marks are protected so people know what's official. See [TRADEMARKS.md](https://github.com/0x1audio/cloud/blob/main/TRADEMARKS.md).
